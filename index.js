 * ### Challenge `processFirstItem`
 * 
 * @instructions
 * Implement a higher-order function called `processFirstItem`.
 * It takes two arguments:
 * @param stringList an array of strings.
 * @param callback function that takes a string as its argument.
 * @returns the result of invoking `callback` with the FIRST element in `stringList`.
 * 
 * Example of usage of this higher-order function:
 * Invoking `processFirstItem` passing `['foo', 'bar']` and `(str) => str + str`,
 * should return 'foofoo'.

/* Task 1: `counterMaker`
 * Study the code for counter1 and counter2. Answer the questions below.
 * 
 * 1. What is the difference between counter1 and counter2?
 * - counter1 is defining count in its lexical scope and then returning an anonymous function that adds 1 to count with every call
 * - counter2 is defining count in the global scope. Additions to count are being done through calling counter2 and this will directly have an impact on the count variable in global.
 * 
 * 2. Which of the two uses a closure? How can you tell?
 * - both functions use closure, but in two different ways. Counter1 uses in function closure and returns a function from within a function. Counter2 uses closure in the context of counter2() reaching out and grabbing the variable from outside its scope and then incrementing it. 
 * 
 * 3. In what scenario would the counter1 code be preferable? In what scenario would counter2 be better? 
 * - If you want to make the count variable more private, then counter1 would be better
 * - counter2 allows more accessibility to the count variable
 * - counter1 allows for less manipulation of the count variable. It can also be re-assigned to many variables at 0 at the same time.  
 *

/* Task 2: inning() 

Write a function called `inning` that generates a random number of points that a team scored in an inning. This should be a whole number between 0 and 2. */

function inning(/*Code Here*/){

    /*Code Here*/

}

/* Task 3: finalScore()

Write a higher order function called `finalScore` that accepts the callback function `inning` (from above) and a number of innings and and returns the final score of the game in the form of an object.

For example, 

finalScore(inning, 9) might return: 
{
  "Home": 11,
  "Away": 5,
}

*/ 

function finalScore(/*code Here*/){

  /*Code Here*/

}

/* Task 4: 

Create a function called `scoreboard` that accepts the following parameters: 

(1) Callback function `getInningScore`
(2) Callback function `inning`
(2) A number of innings

and returns the score at each pont in the game, like so:

1st inning: awayTeam - homeTeam
2nd inning: awayTeam - homeTeam
3rd inning: awayTeam - homeTeam
4th inning: awayTeam - homeTeam
5th inning: awayTeam - homeTeam
6th inning: awayTeam - homeTeam
7th inning: awayTeam - homeTeam
8th inning: awayTeam - homeTeam
9th inning: awayTeam - homeTeam

Final Score: awayTeam - homeTeam */
