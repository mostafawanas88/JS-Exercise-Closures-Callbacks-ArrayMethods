# Scope and Closure Challenge

The module challenge is the afternoon project or assignment that students work through independently. This expands on the guided project completed earlier with the instructor.

## JavaScript Foundations

## Scope and Closures

## Objectives

- Explain function scope
-- Function scope refers to the accessibility of variables in one's program. A local scope is considered to be what is inside the function itself, and is hence only accessible from within the function body. On the other hand, a global scope is one that sits outside of the function body. This is accesible by the function (functions can reach out and access varibale in global scope)  

- Describe what closure is, how closure is created in a program and why it is important to understand closures in JavaScript  
When functions look outward for context. If a variable is not defined within the function body, the function will reach out to the outer / global scope and look for it



## Introduction

This challenge focuses on both scope and closures.

In this challenge you will be working to build a `scoreboard` (in the console) that takes randomly generated data and keeps track of a game's progress. If you're not familiar with the rules of baseball what you need to know is this: there are 9 innings and teams take turns "at-bat." Teams can only score while they are at bat. A team stops being at bat once they have gotten 3 `outs` by either striking out or through game play. You can read more about baseball rules [here](https://www.rulesofsport.com/sports/baseball.html).

A scoreboard in a major league stadium looks something like this. In fact, the scoreboard at Fenway Park in Boston is actually quite famous.

There are layers upon layers of nested functions within the game of baseball. Your challenge today will be to work through tasks associated with these layers, and ultimately to produce a scoreboard that logs in the console.

## Instructions

### Task 1 - Set Up Project and Tests

1. Fork repo and add TL as collaborator on Github
2. Clone _your_ fork (not Lambda's repo by mistake!)
3. `cd` into your newly cloned repository
4. Create a new branch by typing `git checkout -b <firstName-lastName>`
5. Work on your branch, push commits and create PR as usual

### Task 2a - MVP code

Find the file `index.js` and complete the tasks until your tests are passing.

### Task 2b - Written questions

Edit the `ReadMe` file with your answers.

1. In your own words, define closure (1-2 sentences).
    - closure is what gives our function memories 
    - closure stores function by reference in another function
    - closure has access to the parent scope + its own scope
    - once called, it updates based on the previous call
    - in closure, you return the inside function (not call it) and then you can call it later

2. Study the following code, then answer the questions below.

```js
function personalDice(name){
  return function(){
      // generate random number between 1 and 6
    const newRoll = Math.floor(Math.random() * 6);
    console.log(`${name} rolled a ${newRoll}`)
  }
}

const dansRoll = personalDice("Dan");

const zoesRoll = personalDice("Zoe");


dansRoll();
dansRoll();
```

a. Where is closure used in this code? How can you tell?

- closure is being used inside personalDice function. I can tell through the return of an anonymous function inside of it that is able to reach out and grab the argument / variable letter once it is assigned. 

b. Compare and contrast calling `dansRoll` the first and second time. What is always the same? What could change?
- the name Dan (passed in as an argument in dansRoll) will always be constant. The output of the 'newRoll' variable will change everytime the 'dansRoll' is called.

c. What is the lexical scope of `newRoll`? 
- `newRoll` private / lexical scope is the anonymous function it is being defined into. However, given that it is part of the most inner function. `newRoll` can technically reach out and grab any other variable from outside of its private scope.

### Task 3 - Stretch Goals

After you have completed the requirements, **create** a new file called `stretch.js` and practice more with closures. There are no tests for these problems.

See if you can complete one or more of the following challenges:

1. Predict the output of the code below and explain why this is the output using what you learned today. When you're ready for answers, view an explanation [here](https://www.coderbyte.com/algorithm/3-common-javascript-closure-questions

```js
(function(){
  var a = b = 3;
})();
console.log("a defined? " + (typeof a !== 'undefined'));
console.log("b defined? " + (typeof b !== 'undefined'));
```

2. Write a function that would allow you to do this using a closure. (This is another interview question we've seen before - when you're ready for answers, view an explanation [here](https://www.coderbyte.com/algorithm/3-common-javascript-closure-questions)).

```js
var addSix = createBase(6);
addSix(10); // returns 16
addSix(21); // returns 27
```

3. Research the differences between functional programming and object oriented programming. Then, describe the pros and cons of functional programming vs object-oriented programming. This is a common interview question and great practice!

## Submission Format

Follow these steps for completing your project.

- [ ] Submit a pull request to merge <firstName-lastName> Branch into master (student's  Repo). **Please don't merge your own pull request**
- [ ] Add your Team Lead as a reviewer on the pull request
- [ ] Your Team Lead will count the project as complete by merging the branch back into master
